<p>Since I want to use two separate databases (SQL Server for tests and a PostgreSQL for users), I am currently in a process of learning how to properly integrate both databases into EF Core.</p>
<p>Currently, I have done following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Created an SQL Server Database for tests</p></li>
</ul>
