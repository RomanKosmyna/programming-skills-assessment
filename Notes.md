<p>Since I want to use two separate databases (SQL Server for tests and a PostgreSQL for users), I am currently in a process of learning how to properly integrate both databases into EF Core.</p>
<p>Currently, I have done following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Created an SQL Server Database for tests</li>
  <li>Added Models folder</li>
  <li>Added TestType model</li>
  <li>Added Test model</li>
  <li>Added Question model</li>
  <li>Added AnswerOption model</li>
  <li>Added tables into the Database that are corresponding to the models above (with Migration and an Update)</li>
</ul>
